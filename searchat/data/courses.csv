Course Name,Course Description
Financial Accounting,"""This course acquaints students with the process used to construct and understand the financial reports of organizations. The objective is to understand the decisions that must be made in the financial reporting process and to develop the ability to evaluate and use accounting data. Emphasis is placed on understanding the breadth of accounting measurement practices and on being able to make the adjustments necessary for careful analysis. The course highlights the linkages between accounting information and management planning, and decision making and control.\r\n\r\nCourse sections that end in \""H\"" will be taught in a format that combines the convenience and flexibility of online learning with the social and instructional benefits of face-to-face classroom experiences. Online sessions are conducted synchronously with classmates and faculty."""
Managerial Accounting,"""This course covers firms\u0027 internal accounting systems and the information used within organizations for decision-making. It is essential for those students who plan to obtain a management role, work in consulting, or start their own company. The course is organized around the extensive uses of these internal accounting data. The course first covers the fundamentals of assessing the cost of producing a product, providing a service, or servicing a customer. It then moves to addressing issues, such as overhead allocation and shared costs, that can have significant effects on the calculation of product- and divisional-level profitability and managerial decision-making. In the second half of the course, forecasting and monitoring of results are covered, including a discussion of performance evaluation and transfer pricing issues surrounding the location of people and operations. The course is a combination of lecture and case-based discussions, with group cases and an individual in-class midterm and final exam."""
Turbo Accounting,"""An accelerated version of the core accounting course (430), intended for students with recent exposure to accounting principles.  In contrast to 430, this course assumes students already have a working knowledge of the journal entry process. The course explores the principles of financial accounting and the structure and meaning of financial statements and footnote disclosures.  The additional time made available by not covering the journal entry process allows for an in-depth study of many financial reporting issues, and for extra coverage of current financial accounting topics."""
MBAi Financial Accounting,""""""
Financial Planning for Mergers & Acquisitions,"""Many companies are able to identify potential merger partners where combinations can result in significant synergies or value creation, but less than half are able to execute the merger to claim the value created. This course provides the technical knowledge necessary to identify targets as well as prepare business and law practitioners for their future collaborations in the mergers and acquisitions field. The course is offered jointly by the Kellogg School of Management and the Northwestern Law School and is primarily targeted for those interested in planning, analyzing, executing, or facilitating corporate acquisitions. Topics include: economics of mergers and acquisitions, securities law and antitrust regulation, financial reporting issues, tax implications, and economic and legal considerations."""
Financial Reporting and Analysis,"""This course provides a study of current practices in corporate financial reporting and fundamental issues relating to asset valuation and income determination. The emphasis is on financial statement analysis and interpretation of existing financial disclosures. The course stresses critical analyses of financial reporting numbers as a basis for improved risk assessment and cash flow forecasting. Cases are used extensively to enhance relevance."""
Issues in Financial Reporting,"""This course differs from traditional financial accounting classes in that the material is organized according to five broad themes, with particular accounting topics (revenue recognition, lease accounting, etc.) brought in only to the extent that they help elucidate one of the themes. The five themes are: governance and control; quality of earnings; quality of cash flows; consolidation and scope of reporting; fair value reporting and appraisal.\r\n\r\nEach of these themes contain material in which a large portion of Kellogg students would have an interest. For instance, how boards choose non-GAAP metrics; executive compensation contracts (governance and control); how to assess recurring vs. non-recurring profitability (quality of earnings); the sustainability of cash flows (quality of cash flows); the degree of control of a foreign subsidiary or JV (scope of reporting); the valuation of marketing intangibles, such as brands (fair value reporting).\r\n\r\nFormal lectures end in Week 9. Week 10 is reserved for group project presentations. An online version of the Week 9 class will be available for students whose summer internships start before the end of the quarter."""
Global Financial Management and Reporting,"""Designing and executing a global financial strategy is one of the most important duties of senior managers in international organizations. This class will use a mixture of cases and lectures to prepare students to work in this area. Specific topical areas covered will include international taxation and reporting, governance and stewardship in foreign environments, and cross-border financial management. The business questions raised by our exploration of these areas, particularly those related to international taxation, are among the most widely discussed in the business world."""
ESG Investing and Sustainability Reporting,"""This course introduces students to ESG investing and sustainability reporting. It is an exercise to bridge the gap in traditional financial reporting and fundamental analysis, and to provide a new view on how a firm\u0027s social and environmental performance are related to firm value. Through cases, interactions with guest speakers, and a group research project, students will learn about how firms communicate ESG information, how data vendors and analysts analyze ESG information to build sustainability-related metrics, how investors use them to make portfolio decisions, and most importantly, how to overcome some of the associated challenges."""

Special Topics in Empirical Accounting Research,"""Part I: Students will be introduced to research studies that examine unstructured data (e.g., textual) and/or use non-traditional research methods (e.g., machine learning).  We will focus primarily on popular textual measures (e.g., sentiment, readability, and similarity) and machine learning methods (e.g., Na\u0026#239;ve Bayes and Support Vector Machines). The focus will be both on learning the underlying techniques, as well as developing an understanding of the relevant economic contexts in which to apply them to accounting questions.  \r\nPart II: This part of the course will focus on current empirical techniques used in archival accounting research. The focus will be on research design and identification issues in the context of recent and evolving research on disclosure, information processing costs and real effects of reporting and disclosure."""
Empirical Research in Accounting I,"""Students will become acquainted with research questions, methodologies, and findings of empirical research on the implications of accounting information for capital markets through journal readings, replications of existing research, and a final exam. The goal is for students to develop skills in issue identification and research design that can be used to do research and to evaluate research of others."""
Empirical Research in Accounting II,"""This course focuses on examining and evaluating the economic arguments underpinning capital-markets based, empirical accounting research. The course includes discussion and critical assessment of research designs and statistical methods used by accounting researchers with a focus on the appropriateness of the research question. Students are responsible for presenting research papers and preparing a final research proposal."""
Empirical Research in Accounting III,"""Students will be introduced to research studies that examine unstructured data (e.g., textual) and/or use non-traditional research methods (e.g., machine learning). This will include research in economics, finance, and marketing as well as accounting.  We will focus primarily on popular textual measures (e.g., sentiment, readability, and similarity) and machine learning methods (e.g., NaÃ¯ve Bayes and Support Vector Machines).  The focus will be both on learning the underlying techniques, as well as developing an understanding of the relevant economic contexts in which to apply them to accounting questions."""
Research in Accounting Theory I,"""This course provides an introduction to contemporary research in financial accounting theory and is designed for PhD students in Accounting, Economics, and related disciplines. The course analyzes models of voluntary and mandatory disclosures, the design of accounting standards, income measurement, earnings management, and auditing."""
Research in Accounting Theory II,"""Students study economic models of financial reporting and disclosure together with the economics of accounting standards. The course includes study of the linkages among financial accounting, managerial accounting and auditing. Students learn to evaluate the existing models in the literature and to construct basic models of their own."""

Accounting General Credit,"""Accounting General Credit"""
Business Law,"""This course is a survey of the  legal concepts that managers and entrepreneurs will be exposed to in public, private, and non-profit enterprises. It is neither  a surrogate for a law school course ( as such the course is not open to law or JD/MBA students) nor  does it  delve into procedural subjects, (e.g. the rules of civil procedure or evidence). Rather, the students will learn the fundamentals of torts (negligence and intentional), agency, product liability, antitrust, contracts, intellectual property, corporate governance and white collar criminal law (e.g. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). The course content is delivered through lectures, class discussion, study of the case book, and weekly assignments. While 10% of the final grade is determined by the weekly assignments, the remaining portion of the final grade will be assessed in a three-hour, closed book, final essay exam. (There is no formal  group work in this class).  Other than KPPI 952 and BL 437, there is no other course that delves into the issues that will be covered in BL 435."""
Regulation of Competitive Strategies,"""Firms (whether they are brick and mortar or web-based) employ any number of strategies to enhance market share or generate sales. However, for many of those strategies, there is a regulatory component as to their implementation or execution. For example, with respect to pricing decision-making, there are various competition regulations, (e.g. price discrimination, below cost sales, resale price maintenance and/or MAP) at either the state, federal or global level that need to be followed in order to devise a compliant pricing strategy. This course will explore the propriety of at least ten (10) different competitive strategies (e.g. mergers,  distribution channels, patent fencing, exclusionary conduct, cooperative efforts with competitors, etc.). One week of the course will be devoted to criminal enforcement of these rules.  The content will be delivered through lecture, class discussion, case study, and weekly assignments ( there is no group work in the class).  In addition, there will be periodic \""pop up\"" discussions on current competition topics, (e.g. how does antitrust apply to \""Big Tech\""). Ten (10) percent of the final grade is determined by the weekly assignments, while a closed-book essay exam will determine the remainder of the final grade.  BL437 is the only course that serves to provide a regulatory and compliance  road-map for the competitive strategies discussed in other courses."""

Business and Law of Venture Capital,"""The class will focus on venture capital and typical topics that a venture-backed start-up faces in organizing the company, getting funded, scaling its business, and providing liquidity to its investors and employees.  It will offer an overview of venture financing from the perspective of the entrepreneur and investors and cover current legal topics that anyone working in the industry should understand as a business person or lawyer working with start-ups."""
Competition Policy: Antitrust and Intellectual Property,"""Intellectual Property laws create exclusive rights to inventions, to expressive works, and to valuable \""know how,\"" and do so in an effort to induce inventors, writers, musicians, photographers, and so forth, to create and market their works. But, sometimes, holders of IP behave in anticompetitive ways, and use their IP to effectuate anticompetitive plans. When this happens, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice invoke antitrust laws to curb the anticompetitive behavior. Courts and commentators often disagree about which IP behavior comprises antitrust violations. We will survey some of the most common situations, including \""pay for delay,\"" patent pools, standard setting, division of markets, and price fixing."""
Private Equity Transactions,"""This course provides an overview of the private equity industry - its objectives, players and goals. We will follow the investment lifecycle from initial investment assessment to the acquisition and financing process to value creation to exit. We will discuss structuring transactions and key transaction terms, as well as critical governance matters. We will cover key topics that anyone working in the industry should understand as a business person or lawyer."""
Social Entrepreneurship,"""This course combines both theory and practice with an end goal of equipping lawyers and business-minded managers to create a positive social impact.  The course covers the key fundamentals of the social enterprise movement as well as substantive cutting-edge legal doctrine relevant to the sector.  Using the \""case study method\"" typically used in MBA classes, students will examine the challenges of starting, counseling, serving, assessing and funding social ventures through the eyes of the entrepreneur, investor, attorney, board member and community leader.  The course provides an overview of the emergence and definition of social entrepreneurship and will explore the intricacies of establishing mission/vision/values, legal structures for both profit and for non-profit social ventures, managing and sustaining growth and board governance.  This basic knowledge set will inform any student who seeks to advise, launch, and/or serving on the board of a social enterprise.  By engaging with these case studies, students also learn the basics of leadership and management decision-making."""
Information Privacy,"""On May 25, 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) goes into effect.  US Companies and lawmakers are wildly unprepared, relying on outdated enforcement mechanisms and vows of companies who flout data protection.  Global issues of surveillance and propaganda are daily news.  Widespread use of AI in decision-making, revenge porn and deepfakes are commonplace. States react quickly, passing legislation which mimics GDPR and lights a fire under technology companies to lobby for Federal legislation to provide a preemption cover.  How did we get here?  This course will examine the tension between opposing approaches to privacy; how these laws came into being and some of their disparate, intended and unintended consequences. We will have a guest speaker from a Silicon Valley technology company who will discuss how these laws are put into practice in building the technology of tomorrow. By the end of the class you will understand the contours of data privacy in Europe and the US and the factors that have gone into the recent surge of interest in US consumer privacy.  You will also have a greater understanding of how companies struggle with the technology they create; its impact on privacy and how they manage it."""
Intellectual Property Strategies and Implications for Companies,"""This course focuses on intellectual property issues faced by companies. Each class covers different aspects of intellectual property and the business implications for the company.  The topics will include the establishment of a patent program, intellectual-property licensing, intellectual-property issues during mergers and acquisitions, responding to patent infringement assertions, interactions with standard setting organizations, managing a trademark portfolio and protecting a brand, and managing patent litigation.  Where appropriate, the course provides interactive exercises that simulate scenarios commonly faced by companies.  Guest speakers are invited to provide the benefit of their perspectives and experiences on the various topics."""
"The Business, Law, and Technology of Space Commerce","""This course introduces the basics of the business, technology and law of space commerce.  We will review the key historical moments of space exploration, the science of space, and the government\u0027s role in promoting space exploration as these factors have influenced the development of the business and law of space commerce.  An deeper exploration of the U.S. law and regulatory frameworks, as well as international treaties, that have developed over the last half century around space exploration informs our understanding of the current space commerce environment.  We also consider the role of national security and the various U.S. agencies involved in space military and commercial activities and how the two are linked.  Upon completion of this course, students will have a strong grasp of the evolving business models for the industries of space commerce and the role and influence of law. These outcomes will be achieved through a variety of formats: readings and class discussions, guest speakers, a project presentation and a final paper."""

Entrepreneurship and Market Creation in Emerging Markets,"""Only 7% of people in the world live on more than $50 a day.  This course is about learning the necessary entrepreneurial skills that will enable you create new markets that serve the remaining 93%, most of whom live in emerging economies.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, this course has five goals.\r\n\r\n1. To provide you with a lens that will help you see and assess the opportunities that exist in emerging economies.\r\n2. To equip you with the relevant tools and frameworks to help you tackle the challenges unique to building a successful venture in emerging economies.\r\n3. To walk you through the process, from start to finish, of developing an idea that can serve customers in emerging markets.\r\n4. To introduce you to seasoned entrepreneurs, investors, and stakeholders in emerging market startup ecosystems who will provide feedback on your idea at the end of the class.\r\n5. To practicalize your learning by having you work on a real market-creating project with real companies across emerging markets. This will help you develop your own entrepreneurial idea for emerging markets.\r\n\r\nIn emerging markets, cost is often seen as the primary barrier preventing customers from purchasing (or consuming) a product. This course will introduce other barriers especially in the context of emerging markets and will also provide a framework for how students can design business models that take into consideration these additional barriers.\r\n\r\nFrom the first session to the last, the focus of this course will be on applying the skills, lessons, and frameworks you learn to develop market-creating ideas so that, at the end of the course, you have the confidence to present a viable business proposal to prospective investors."""
Intellectual Property for Entrepreneurs,"""This course will teach what entrepreneurs need to know to secure and leverage the knowledge based assets of their business as intellectual property.

Value Investing,"""This course will introduce students to the traditional Graham, Dodd, and Buffett Value Investing framework as it has evolved over time (VI Framework). The framework explicitly takes into account the fact that for every security you decide to buy or sell there are other investors who take the opposite position and they may be right.  As you will see in the course, the VI Framework as it stands today is suitable for making investment decisions involving growth stocks as well. The learning objectives are: (a) Develop an in depth understanding of the VI Framework.  (b) Demonstrate your grasp of the VI Framework by applying it in your stock selection project. (c) Present the analysis in an organized manner and develop the ability to work in teams by defining individuals\u0027 roles and tasks and managing conflicts for successful completion of group projects.

Entrepreneurial Finance and Venture Capital,"""This course uses the case method, alongside selected lectures and guest speakers, to study entrepreneurial finance and venture capital decision focusing on the funding decisions of start-ups (fast growing entrepreneurial firms). The goal is to understand how entrepreneurs can raise funds and how venture capital partnerships choose, value, structure, fund, and manage their investments. The course covers all stages of the financing process, from startup to exit, structuring multi-staged financings, and valuing entrepreneurial ventures. In addition, the course provides insight into how venture capital partnerships work, why they take the forms they do, and where the crucial problems and opportunities for innovation exist. Consideration is given to the incentives faced by venture capital partnerships and the investors in those partnerships, and how to properly make financing decisions and negotiate contractual terms. The course emphasizes high growth start-ups searching for funding in the US and venture capital funding as opposed to more traditional entrepreneurial and family firms operating globally (see FINC945 for these topics) and to Leveraged Buyouts (see FINC-448 for LBOs).  The course is aimed primarily at people who may be involved in an entrepreneurial venture at some point in their careers, those interested in pursuing venture capital careers, or those interested in asset management. The coursework will consist of case study write-ups as well as a take-home final exam."""
Financial Strategy and Tax,"""Taxes are a crucial component of the most investor\u0027s asset allocation decision. After tax-returns are the portion investors keep. Taxes are also a crucial component of firm\u0027s investment and financing decisions. Unfortunately, knowledge of how taxes work is often left to the experts. This means that many opportunities for creating value for firms and investors are missed. This course will not make you a tax expert. You will still need to hire a tax expert. Instead the objective is to teach you enough of the structure of tax codes (past, current, and future; US and non-US) so that you can ask intelligent tax, business, and finance questions before it is too late. The class is designed to fill the gap between an MBA who is well trained in finance and the tax experts that you will rely on in your career. This is a rare and thus valuable position to be in.

"Keeping it all in the Family: Growing, Financing, and Managing Family Firms","""Most companies around the world are owned or controlled by their founding families.  The subject of the course is these firms in their different forms: private family firms, closely held firms, family offices and family investment offices.  The course explores the unique finance, legal, governance and management issues faced by family firms, and ways in which these issues can be addressed. The course provides students interested in founding, owning, managing, investing in, or partnering with such firms with a framework for analyzing how family ownership and control affect value, and how this value is created and allocated to the various stakeholders of the firm.  The course specifically focuses on the financial, legal and corporate governance aspects of family control and their managerial implications. \r\n\r\nThe topics in the course include: family ownership, control and management affecting firm-value; legal standards of valuation (fair value vs. fair market value); shareholder agreements and bylaws; control-enhancing mechanisms, including dual-stock structures, pyramidal structures, board representation; families partnering with strategic investors, financial investors, employers and public shareholders; legal and governance structures; family succession planning, estate planning (gits, wills, trusts and estates); formulating optimal plans for transferring control, and the organizational design of family offices and family investment offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eIf a student does \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003enot\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e meet the prerequisite requirements, s/he may take this course \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eonly\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e if the permission of the instructor is given.

Private equity and hedge fund can use debt as a strategic tool to create value for their investors through access to cheaper and more flexible debt financing; expertise in restructuring debt contracts; and access to more stable financing. The course is structured around the mechanisms of value creation through debt including deal structuring, debt restructuring, tax rules applicable to debt restructuring in different jurisdictions, investing in corporate and sovereign debt and distressed assets in general. Understanding how syndicate constituency, secondary market trading, and market conditions influence the renegotiation process requires in-depth understanding of debt markets and the legal aspects of restructuring. The overall theme is to restructure turn-around investments in overleveraged and troubled companies. Topics include: investment strategies pursued by PE investors including purchase of distressed assets, assets fire sales and taking control of the restructuring plan; loan-to-loan vs. loan-to-own investment strategies; vulture investors and the fulcrum security; dual role of PE investors as a financial sponsor and having a \""say\"" in the reorganization plan; amended plans and the role of unsecured creditors; and sovereign debt bankruptcy provisions (i.e., collective action clauses, cross-default, pari-passu and rights upon future offer).\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eIf a student does \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003enot\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e meet the prerequisite requirements, s/he may take this course \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eonly\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e if the permission of the instructor is given.

The course will help students understand the concept of arbitrage and the limits of arbitrage opportunities.   There will be a particular focus on asking why outsized returns exist in specific cases of market inefficiency.  Students will be exposed to a myriad of potential root causes including counterparty risk, liquidity risk and investor segmentation.  Through the course, students will learn how to price and evaluate a wide variety of financial instruments including depository receipts, credit default swaps, convertible bonds and distressed debt. The aim of the course is to give students several examples of bona fide market inefficiency and give them the tools to assess (and potentially capitalize on) future market opportunities in real-time"""
Strategic Financial Planning and Wealth Management,"""This course is a hands-on, problem-solving-based introduction to the questions, concepts, analytical tools, and financial instruments useful for financial planning. We teach financial planning from the perspective of the life-cycle model of consumption, where individuals wish to smooth consumption over their lifetimes, while at the same time achieve a set of financial goals. From this perspective, we address the most pressing questions any financial plan will face. The first question is how do individual preferences impact the optimal level of consumption and savings over the lifecycle. This leads naturally to an understanding of â€œrules-of-thumbâ€ regarding any individualâ€™s progress towards successful implementation of a financial plan and in particular, whether an individualâ€™s savings are consistent with the individualâ€™s goals. The second question is whether an individual has identified, measured, and managed the risks faced by all financial plans. This provides guidance on what risks one should bear and which risks should be hedged or insured against. The third question is whether the wealth one amasses will be sufficient to accomplish oneâ€™s long-term goals. We address this in an environment where not only are investment rates of return random, but so too are the lengths of realized planning horizons (lifetimes). The fourth question is how particular financial instruments (e.g. annuities, insurance, reverse mortgages) can be used to address the uncertainty surrounding planning horizons. Finally, we identify the common â€œpitfallsâ€ observed in financial planning as well as the practical challenges to getting help with achieving oneâ€™s financial goals. The course is designed for students with or without a financial industry background, who may be interested in pursuing careers in wealth management, or who simply wish to gain appreciation for the real-world practical difficulties one faces in accomplishing oneâ€™s lifetime financial goals."""
FinTech and Society,"""Since the Great Recession, financial intermediation has undergone a dramatic change, with disruptive and lightly regulated technology entrants (FinTechs) competing with traditional banks in every aspect of their business, and even launching financial products that had not existed before. This course explores the opportunities and challenges at the intersection of finance, technology, and regulation, and assesses their impact on broader society.\r\n\r\nWe aim to develop an understanding of the broad landscape of FinTech, including the use of blockchain technology for cryptocurrencies and DeFi,  as well as disruptive innovations in the areas of real estate, asset management, payments, and lending to businesses and households. The course aims to develop tools used to evaluate the profitability of FinTech opportunities from the perspective of the financial product markets, competition, regulation, and funding, and the role that technology plays in overcoming challenges faced by incumbents.  We will also evaluate the role of FinTech in promoting financial inclusion - access to cheap and efficient financial services to the underbanked population, and its ability to alleviate or exacerbate the problem of discrimination in the financial sector. This approach will allow students to evaluate Fintech opportunities from the perspective of their own value system."""

The course provides a unique window into the activity and decision processes used by VC funds on a daily basis. The primary perspective of the course is that of the venture capitalist in assembling and evaluating information, preparing forecasts, assessing risks, developing and negotiating investment structure and terms, and deciding whether to invest. Cases also touch on management and financial problems and policy issues, and the relationship between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. The secondary perspective is that of the entrepreneur and the techniques and skills employed in managing growing enterprises. The course employs a flipped classroom approach, whereby significant preparation is completed outside the classroom prior to the course sessions, such that we can focus on in-depth discussion for the full class period. The course is aimed at students who are considering a career in the entrepreneurial sector, including those who wish to start new ventures, join new and growing organizations, or to work in the venture capital or related industry.

In-class exercises will allow students the opportunity to learn firsthand about the analyses, methodologies, and techniques. The first four classes will consist of approximately 1 to 2 hours of lecture followed by an in-class project for the remainder of the period. Supplemental readings related to the material covered in classes two through five will also be assigned. A final exam, covering material from weeks 1-4, will be administered in the final class."""
Using Analytics to Create and Capture Value in Healthcare,"""This course is for managers who want to better understand empirical arguments in the healthcare industry. Students will become familiar with basic tools of modern data science through hands-on experience and will learn how to use analytics and data to address decisions faced by healthcare firms. Data-driven analyses require going beyond statistically significant relationships to assess cause and effect. This course extends regression analysis to answer causal questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important tool we will develop is the ability to be a good consumer of arguments made with data. Within healthcare, firms frequently make claims about the impact of various initiatives. In this course, we will spend substantial time evaluating those claims. Will value-based care lower costs? Will firms be able to capture some of the incremental value created? Will investing in quality improve outcomes or firm profits? Will advertising increase firm profits?"""
Managing Health Care Services in a Value Based Setting,"""Healthcare services have long existed in a fee-for-service world where providers could maximize profits through the provision of a great quantity of services. Existing institutions blunted incentives to provide high quality care or care that resulted in a downstream reduction in the use of healthcare services. This world is changing - with many providers and payers moving towards a value-based regime where firms can earn profits when patients receive higher quality care thereby reducing downstream utilization, often of acute, specialty, and post-acute care. In response to this new reality there is a growing number of new entrants attempting to manage the care of enrollees in both public and private health insurance plans in a variety of value-based payment models. Additionally, many incumbent firms are modifying their strategies for this new paradigm.\r\n\r\nSuccess in a value-based world requires firms to develop and/or acquire new assets and implement new operating models. This course is a study of the systems necessary to succeed in this new world with a focus on the finance, strategy, marketing, and economics of care delivery in a value-based model. Our objective is to understand how the healthcare system is organized (or not) and managed (or not) so that we can create and capture value through the delivery of care. A large focus of the course will be about how smaller players and new entrants engage with the large and powerful incumbents that are central to the existing system."""
Value Creation and Capture in Biopharmaceuticals,"""Biopharmaceutical innovation results from the interaction of a complex set of firms that both generate and finance early stage products. As potential scientific innovations move through the research and development process, the various firms require both the involvement of increasingly sophisticated managers and infusions of additional capital from the private and the public market. This can often involve acquisitions or licensing with existing players - many of which have effectively outsourced large portions of drug discovery to these early stage firms.\r\n\r\nAs a result, determining how value is created and captured in this area requires understanding the incentives and motivations of all of the players in the system, including but not limited to small biotechs, large pharmaceutical firms, venture capitalists, pubic investors, and private equity firms. This is true whether one is interested in operating an early stage firm, undertaking business development activities at larger firms, or being an investor in the public or private market. \r\n \r\nThis course combines elements of your previous strategy, finance, and healthcare curriculum with new concepts and techniques specific to biopharmaceutical that will allow you to better understand this market. Students will apply tools of valuation and strategic decision making to both large and small firms that are attempting to develop and market new biopharmaceutical innovations. This will include both individual and group coursework requiring the use of concepts from previous finance, strategy, and economics courses - where groups will include a mixture of students with more and less backgrounds in each of these areas. After this course students will have a thorough understanding of the early stage biopharmaceutical market from both the point of view of an investor and a manager."""

Personal Leadership Insights,"""This course is a unique opportunity for students who are highly motivated and committed to their personal development and growth as a leader and who value the chance to do this work in a group setting.  The Kellogg faculty leader serves as coach and facilitator to guide students through a process that explores who they are (strengths, needs, values), reveals how others experience them (feedback), examines who they want to be (vision/purpose) and identifies actions for moving forward (development planning). Individual reflective exercises will be further explored and shared in small group meetings, full class discussion, and individual coaching appointments with the faculty. Students complete a paper integrating their personal insights. There is no final exam.\r\n \r\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the course focuses on self-awareness and relationships with others, students rely on interactions with each other to experience vulnerability and growth within an environment of safety and trust.

Leader as Coach,"""Coaching or \""the coach approach\"" (using elements of coaching in day-to-day interactions), is a critical skill set for successful leaders. Research shows that coaching is a proven method for engaging employees - and that engaged employees produce superior business results. This is an experiential class that teaches you how to have effective coaching conversations.  As part of the course, you are matched with two NU students in which you will have four one-hour coaching conversations with each NU student throughout the quarter to practice your coaching skills.  In the full-time program, the assigned NU students are undergraduates usually in leadership roles and PhD students.  In the part-time program, the assigned NU students are typically medical, law school and Kellogg MSMS students. \r\n\r\nThe first four weeks of class is dedicated to teaching you coaching skills and frameworks through interactive discussions, coaching demonstrations, peer coaching and other experiential exercises.  During weeks five through nine, we conduct supplemental activities: practicum labs, one-on-one, and small group mentor coaching sessions to provide you with more personalized opportunities for you to ask questions, experience being coached, and receive feedback on your coaching skills.  We return to the classroom in week ten to discuss how to apply coaching in the workplace.

Selling Yourself and Your Ideas,"""It\u0027s been said that humans are \""meaning making machines.\"" More than 70,000 years ago, near the outset of the Cognitive Revolution, we created language to help protect and organize ourselves.1 Over the ensuing millennia, we have developed myriad ways to communicate with each other. Present day, our communications take many forms, and so we find ourselves in conversations, meetings, presentations, and even as producers on social media.\r\n \r\nAs business leaders, we move through these many forms of communications in the course of a week, and indeed we can even traverse each of them within one day. In order to be dynamic, high-performing communicators, we must do three things:\r\n1.           Be cognizant of what high performance looks like in each of these distinct modes of communication; \r\n2.          Develop a situational awareness for how to succeed in each form; and\r\n3.           Become agile in calibrating our approach. \r\n \r\nSelling Yourself \u0026 Your Ideas is a course that will force you out of your comfort zone to help you show up, stand out, and break through.

Leader Development Models and Practices,"""This is a foundational course in the leadership field that deals with a core competency and responsibility for managers: developing leaders.  In short, it concentrates on how we (as leaders in organizations) can develop team members to realize their potential.  Growing others\u0027 talents helps managers to accomplish the mission and improve their organizations.  The course builds upon MORS 430-0 (which examined leadership in organizations from a variety of perspectives).  KACI 930-5 employs a variety of pedagogy techniques (e.g., lectures, discussion groups, guest speakers) and requires students to submit a final paper detailing how course material relates to a leader development activity that is germane to their life.  The course integrates theories and frameworks associated with constructs related to organizations, leadership, and adult development in order to provide you a more complete understanding of how leaders are nurtured.  By the end of the course, you will be able to more cogently analyze and address team members\u0027 developmental needs and situations."""
Moral Complexity in Leadership: An Exploration through Literature,"""In this course, literature serves as the entry point to analyze morally complex matters and then formulate and communicate cogent opinions about them in a group. Through literature, we will pull out common themes of classic moral quandaries that leaders face (e.g. pernicious issues such as greed or self-deceit, operating as an \""agent of another\"" whom you disagree with, fractured professional and personal life, the troubles with \""likability,\"" etc). We will then examine how characters in the stories and real-world business leaders have grappled with such issues and analyze how individuals make choices congruent with their values, what actions convey care for the systems within which they operate (or are responsible for), and perhaps most importantly, what can get them off track.  Students will not only read critically and carefully, but will also learn the arts of listening well, facilitating dialog amidst disagreement, and articulating sound arguments through weekly reflection papers and their conversations with one another.\r\n\r\nThe course is built around weekly small group discussions in class and a plenary lecture on the week\u0027s themes in the business world. The emphasis is on deep, rigorous reflection and meaningful communication rather than sound bites or quick tips. The reading materials span centuries, continents and viewpoints, building respect for the complexity of those we interact with on a daily basis. This discussion-based course includes weekly homework assignments (reading and writing), a group project analyzing a film that conveys moral complexity, and a final, individual paper and brief presentation on a work of your choosing."""

Competitive Strategy and Industrial Structure,"""This course studies competitive strategy: interactions between firms in concentrated industries. The focus is on strategies for softening price competition and on how industry fundamentals influence the effectiveness of those various strategies. Topics include product positioning, product proliferation, dynamic aspects of pricing, price discrimination strategies (e.g., coupons and loyalty programs), entry into an industry, and responding to entry attempts. A common theme is that the success or failure of a strategy often depends on how your competitors will respond. As a result, what may be a winning strategy for a monopolist can sometimes backfire in an oligopoly. The course will mix lectures and case studies, as well as both qualitative and quantitative components. Evaluation will be primarily based on homework assignments, exams (a final and a midterm), and a term paper that will be written in teams."""
Pricing Strategies,"""This course provides students with a comprehensive framework for formulating and implementing pricing strategies. Notable topics include 1) the design of pricing schemes that segment the market, such as peak-load pricing, product bundling, and nonlinear pricing; 2) vertical pricing problems (transfer pricing, pricing and distribution); 3) legal constraints on pricing; and 4)  the use of auctions as a pricing strategy, with a special focus on online ad auctions. \r\n\r\nWe will learn techniques and frameworks that take account the often imprecise and uncertain information to which management has access. We also discuss research methods that can complement managerial judgment and the importance of maintaining consistency with other elements of the marketing mix.

Big Data Advanced Analytics Workshopï»¿,"""\u003cp\u003eInference with big data is central to business today, where evidenced-based decisions are highly valued. Doing this is difficult because real world situations are often complex and fast-paced, and data can be simultaneously \""big\"" and yet imperfect. In the real world, one has to analyze data for different types of decisions and situations and is rarely in the position of choosing his/her ideal data or setting. This means that the quality of the data and the method with which one can make inferences vary greatly across contexts. Moreover, handling big data, where one cannot visualize the entire dataset and visually identify problems, requires knowledge of advanced regression modeling and post-estimation techniques. Business leaders in such situations need to extract useful insights from data with advanced statistical modelling, and to communicate these insights in a non-technical and intuitive way so that others can understand.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis class addresses these needs by teaching advanced statistical modelling with big data, and practicing communicating these ideas at all levels of technicality (or non-technicality). It takes a practical view of statistics and data analysis with large datasets and provides students with a range of advanced state-of-the-art statistical and basic machine learning tools to address economic questions.  Two unique cases were developed especially for this class. One of the cases is an \""open-ended\"" project in which students will be required to apply the tools they learn to build a statistical model for analysis and then design business strategy based on the evidence. Each case reflects a highly complex real-world situations and evolve across lectures in stages so that students learn advanced analytical skills in a concrete context-relevant setting.

Throughout the course, we examine the proper use of statistical analyses with an emphasis on the interpretation and use of results. Students work individually to learn appropriate utilization of marketing research techniques to solve business problems."""
Omnichannel Experience Strategy,"""In a world saturated with new commerce options, consumers and business buyers are radically changing their expectations and behaviors across the entire cycle of learning, shopping, buying, and using products and services. How does a modern business manage its brands across the vast array of new channel models, from brick and mortar showroom stores to e-commerce sites to experiential pop-ups and apps? In this course, students will learn how to structure and manage networks of partners into cohesive, brand-enhancing omnichannel ecosystems that reach end-customers any place and any time, whether through social commerce channels, mobile devices, in-person store environments, platform apps, or product story, photo and video sharing sites. Like the fast-evolving business models we will be studying, this class is both strategic and practical, and most of the situations we will analyze are from real-world developments and managerial problems. The course takes a senior leadership perspective, offering frameworks and analytical tools for effectively moving an organization outside the comfort zone of legacy beliefs and relationships, and into the new omnichannel world."""
Business-to-Business (B2B) Marketing,"""With over half the global economy in Business-to-Business (B2B) markets, consultants, PE professionals and those working directly in industry are highly likely to be competing in a B2B market at some point, and yet most Kellogg marketing courses skew toward consumer marketing examples. B2B purchase decisions are made in complex, high-price/high-risk, multi-stakeholder environments. Today\u0027s rapid technological advances are transforming B2B customer value requirements and the business models needed to deliver them.  How does one not merely survive in these challenging markets, but succeed? \r\n\r\nThis course provides a practical understanding of four primary B2B marketing processes: choosing, creating, communicating and converting customer value into profit and growth. It builds on MKTG 430 (Marketing Management) by focusing on the application of methods/tools that are unique to B2B markets. Using a mix of articles, lectures from current practitioners, class discussion, cases, and your own group research projects, we will apply frameworks and tools to:\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eidentify \u0026 quantify value to B2B customers,\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003ecraft more compelling B2B value propositions,\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eprice to achieve business objectives,\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003esegment and target the most attractive B2B customers,\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003ecreate and manage new B2B business models, and \u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eintegrate marketing communication throughout the longer, more complex B2B customer journey\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\r\nInstead of a final exam, a group research project is presented on the final day of class"""
Advertising Strategy,"""Companies spend $560 billion on advertising worldwide and a great deal of it is wasted. This class is designed to teach students to be stronger critical thinkers with an emphasis on developing more effective advertising across traditional and digital channels. Created for client-side managers tasked with advertising responsibilities as well as general managers overseeing communications, the class tackles both advertising strategy and execution. In a rapidly evolving marketing ecosystem, it\u0027s never been more important to have a strategic lens. This course emphasizes the development of the central nucleus of any advertising strategy- the creative brief- to manage and guide relationship with your creative partners.  \r\n \r\nThe first half focuses on general advertising strategy - creating meaningful goals; selecting an attractive target for advertising, uncovering actionable insights, and developing an effective brand position. The remainder of the course examines the strategic planning of the tactical execution- understanding media, evaluating creative, and measuring effectiveness. The emphasis of the class is on practical application. As such, the courses analyzes advertising challenges through real-life examples. Students review cases weekly, complete several case assignments, tackle a current company\u0027s situation in a group assignment, and complete a take home final comprised of mini-cases."""
Product Management for Technology Companies: An Entrepreneurial Perspective,"""Product Management for Technology Companies provides the conceptual frameworks, tools and hands-on experience to become successful product managers in technology companies. With a holistic and entrepreneurial perspective of product management, the course provides an end-to-end view of all major aspects of product management and product marketing.

The case studies and assignments in the course are all developed at Kellogg and designed specifically for the course. Assignments include a wireframing assignment, a SaaS economics quantitative assignment and a product roadmapping assignment. The case studies and course content reflect a balance between product management in large technology companies versus smaller technology startup companies."""
Services Marketing and Management,"""Services dominate the U.S. and the world\u0027s economy. In the U.S. approximately 81% of the labor force and 80% of the GDP are accounted for by services. In fact, services provide most of the new jobs in many developing and highly developed economies. More importantly, services increasingly drive the competitive advantage of many successful companies in all industry sectors around the globe. This course focuses on unique and fundamental challenges of managing service brands and delivering quality service (as well as memorable experiences) to consumers across industry sectors. You will gain critical skills and knowledge to manage service brands (e.g., banking, entertainment, hospitality and healthcare, professional services) and implement service strategies to companies that depend on services for competitive advantage (e.g., manufacturing business, automotive, retail). This course will further incorporate service design thinking and experience management framework to give you a holistic insight into the service management approach."""
Retail Analytics and Pricing,"""This course will teach you how to use analytics and data to address decisions faced by retailers and manufacturers. Pricing and promotion decisions are emphasized, with additional coverage on topics such as private labels, product assortment, trade funding, shopper marketing, and more. The course is organized around a hierarchy of topics. We spend roughly one week understanding pricing and promoting to an individual customer. This analysis provides the foundation as we move to more aggregate decisions, such as setting regular and promoted prices at the product level, managing category pricing, and understanding the drivers of store traffic. As we progress through this hierarchy of decisions, we illustrate how different types of data can---or can\u0027t---be used to answer managerial questions. A key part of the class is understanding the limitations of different types of data and how better planning can both simplify the analytics and increase your confidence in the findings. This class is very practical and hands-on. Most of the data we analyze is from real-world managerial problems, through collaborations with leading retailers and consulting firms who have brought problem-driven challenges to the classroom. Weekly homework assignments, both individual and group, are paired with in-class cases. There is no final exam."""
Launching New Products and Services,"""The course deals with the challenge of launching new products and services into the market. Focusing mainly on large and established companies interested in pursuing growth, we will discuss the steps needed to bring products to market, including understanding customer needs, conducting sales forecasts, and designing a launch plan, including targeting, positioning, advertising, pricing, and distribution decisions. Class sessions will include a combination of lectures, in-class exercises, case discussions, simulations, and guest speakers. Deliverables include individual and groups assignments and a final group project."""

Industries covered in the course include software, online services, medical equipment and hardware. All case studies in the course have been developed at Kellogg specifically for the course."""
Strategic Brand Management,"""As many products and services are becoming commoditized, brands are becoming increasingly important as key non-price differentiators. As a result, brands now have the potential to play an even greater role in creating value for customers as well as for the company. In this course, you will learn how to create and manage successful brands. We will discuss the key factors that enable brands to create value, focusing on the strategic aspects of building strong brands. You will learn about brand management in three different formats. First, you will learn from the lectures and the assigned course materials, which provide the background necessary to address the problems we will discuss in class. The second venue for learning is class discussions. Here you will have the opportunity to present your point of view and defend it against those of your classmates. Our goal for the class discussion is to come up with a viable solution for the branding problem faced by the company. Finally, the third learning venue is the individual case preparation and the case-related discussions within each team prior to discussing the case in class.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of this course is to enhance your knowledge of branding and brand management.

It deals with several discrete topics holistically with emphasis on the practical realities in the C-Suite and the Boardroom. It is a particularly useful platform of learning for students who wish to understand the \""real world\"" implications of being in the C-Suite. Unlike most classes, the subjects are non-linear and do not necessarily build on each other.\r\n\r\nThere will be a number of guest speakers at the C-level."""
Critical Thinking in Digital and Social Media Marketing,"""Marketing in the modern digital landscape involves a number of challenges as platforms, technology, competitive landscapes, data availability, and analytics techniques evolve rapidly.

Customer Analytics and AI,"""Marketing is evolving from an art to a science. Many firms have extensive information about consumers\u0027 choices and how they react to marketing campaigns, but few firms have the expertise to intelligently act on such information. In this course, students will learn the scientific approach to marketing with hands-on use of technologies such as databases, analytics, machine learning, and computing systems to collect, analyze, and act on customer information. While students will employ quantitative methods in the course, the goal is not to produce experts in statistics; rather, students will gain the competency to interact with and manage a marketing analytics and AI team.\r\n\r\nWe will use the statistics program R in Customer Analytics and AI. R is harder to use that Stata but has become the industry standard (together with Python) and is extremely good for data management, visualization, and Machine Learning. Before you start the course, you will need to learn how to use R using tutorials and online course. There will be an assignment that is due at the beginning of the first class to make sure that you are sufficiently proficient in R before the course starts. Please do not take this class if you are not willing or able to make this investment.\r\n\r\nThe course consists of lectures, in-class exercises, group work, and case discussions. You will use R throughout the class to work with individual-level customer data. \r\n\r\nThe course has no final; instead, students are evaluated on their performance on weekly assignments. \r\n\r\nThis course has no overlap with other existing analytics or AI courses at Kellogg. The course is an excellent companion to Retail Analytics."""

"Consumers, Culture & Strategy","""The success of every organization depends on its ability to attract and retain customers. Traditionally, firms have done so by seeking to understand and respond to customers. Firms that meet customers needs best gain competitive advantage. Legendary firms such as Toyota and Unilever thrived using this market-driven approach. \r\nRejecting this approach, firms such as Apple and Starbucks embrace a market-driving approach. Drawing on their organization\u0027s culture, these firms compete to gain influence over consumers. Firms that win influence shape consumer thinking and achieve success that competitors struggle to imitate.\r\nIn this course, we will explore the many different ways in which firms win this battle for influence. Our classes will focus on discussions of concepts, examples and cases. Students will be responsible for developing individual recommendations prior to case discussions, one written group case analysis, and the course will have an individual final exam."""

Decision Models & Prescriptive Analytics,"""\u003cp\u003eThe value of analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) in today\u0027s business landscape cannot be overstated. These tools have become integral to the decision-making process for many organizations across a variety of industries, including services, marketing, transportation, online platforms, and finance. AI systems often utilize a range of analytics techniques to make data-driven, evidence-based decisions. The analytics tools can be broadly classified to three types:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eDescriptive (What happened?): The interpretation of historical data to identify trends and patterns\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003ePredictive (What will happen?): The use of statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast future outcomes\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003ePrescriptive (What should be done?): The use of data-driven models to prescribe the best action plan.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003ePrescriptive analytics, in particular, plays a key role in the functionality of AI systems. This type of analytics involves the use of data-driven models to determine the best course of action in a given situation, based on data and analysis of past outcomes and trends. By utilizing prescriptive analytics, organizations can make informed, strategic decisions that optimize outcomes and drive business success. For example, an AI system might use prescriptive analytics to determine the best way to match drivers with riders, recommend the best portfolio of stocks, or to recommend the most effective marketing campaign for a new product.

Successful business leaders have recognized that these challenges are best mastered by a commitment to values-based management. However, simply \""doing the right thing\"" is not enough. Rather, companies increasingly find themselves as targets of aggressive legal action, media coverage and social pressure. Organizations must be prepared to handle rapidly changing environments and anticipate potential threats. This requires a deep understanding of the strategic complexities in managing various stakeholders and constituencies. To confront students with these challenges in a realistic fashion, the class is structured around a rich set of challenging case studies and crisis simulation exercises."""
Strategy Beyond Markets,"""Many business models are hostage to laws and regulations (Uber, AirBnB, Facebook, fracking, ...). Other business models cater specifically to existing regulations (electric vehicles, e.g.). These laws and regulations represent the \""rules of the competitive game.\"" \r\n\r\nThese rules of the game favor some business models over others, but they are not fixed: they are subject to change. Uber, for example, is able to gain a license to operate by changing the rules of the competitive game in a given jurisdiction.

Managing Sustainability Transformations,"""This course is centrally concerned with to create companies that contribute to sustainability while generating economic value in competitive markets. It is based on three premises: First, that sustainability for most companies is no longer just a matter of compliance or social responsibility but is becoming a material imperative for the future viability of the business. This is because sustainability-related natural resource dynamics, regulatory changes, shifts in consumer and investor preferences, and technological innovation are driving disruptive change and transformations in many industries, including energy, mobility, real estate, food and financial services. The second premise is that \u0027real\u0027 sustainability is still difficult and that standard ways of approaching business decisions fall short on delivering effective solutions to issues like climate change or environmental justice. While win-win-win scenarios between economic prosperity, environmental quality, and social equity do exist, they are neither easy to recognize nor easy to execute, unless we integrate sustainability into management and decision processes. The third and last premise is that the key challenge for most companies is executing a strategy for changing their processes, products and business models while maintaining a high level of financial performance. For example, how should a CPG company achieve carbon neutrality targets and eliminate plastic waste? What are entrepreneurial opportunities in plant based meat substitution? How can an airline or property developer decarbonize their business? The course introduces a set of advanced practices and frameworks for holistically integrating sustainability into business decisions. This means on the one hand, learning the fundamental principles of sustainability and how they relate to economic value creation, identifying drivers and impediments for making sustainability material to value creation, and charting different pathways for effective sustainability transformations. It means on the other hand learning to use key tools for assessing in a systematic way the environmental and social impacts of existing business models. The course provides a thorough foundation for students that seek to specialize in sustainability in their work, and for students that need a holistic overview that allows them to integrate sustainability in a non-specialist role. The pedagogical format combines the introduction of conceptual frameworks, experiential exercises, case analyses and guest speakers."""
Early Stage Impact Investing,"""More and more entrepreneurs are launching businesses that reflect their values, and early stage impact investors plays a critical role in funding these innovative companies. In this course, students will gain practical, hands-on experience evaluating the impact and business potential of startup companies, from sourcing deals through investment recommendations.  During the course, student will work in teams to analyze and perform initial due diligence on an early stage impact investment opportunity.  Students will present their recommendation to a panel of judges as their final project for the class. This course, in contrast to Kellogg\u0027s FINC 946 which focuses on institutional impact investing, will focus on direct investing in early stage impact companies through a venture capital lens."""
Decision-Making for Sustainable Business,"""The role of business in society is changing with increasing expectations that business will deliver value not just to shareholders, but also to multiple other stakeholders, whilst taking care of and respecting the environment.  Corporate management and reporting systems are now required to keep pace with these changing expectations, and corporate Boards need the tools and frameworks to make decisions that take these competing demands in to account. This 5-week course will explore the challenges the C-Suite and the Board Room face in meeting sustainable business expectations and introduce the emerging tools and frameworks available to enable them to manage and report their progress in the 21st century. Through lectures, case studies and simulated situations, students will learn practical tools and frameworks used by business to understand their role in society, how they measure and report impact, how they align their strategy with government policy (through the Sustainable Development Goals) and how to formulate a business case for transformational and sustainable practices."""
Social Impact Analytics,"""Social impact investments and corporate social responsibility outreach are often well intentioned, but their returns to the investor or targeted group may be variable, particularly in international contexts. This course develops an understanding of quantitative methods to measure social impact motivated by the particular challenges inherent in quantifying impact in a socio-economic setting.  We will use previous studies to better understand what works and why, but also how impact was measured across different types of social investments."""
Strategic Leadership in the Nonprofit Sector,"""Nonprofit and Non-Governmental organizations strive to meet the most complex challenges of our time. Today, the sector is being profoundly impacted by the challenges of COVID 19, a global economic recession, as well as growing calls for diversity, equity and inclusion in the US and beyond.

The Business of Social Change,"""This course is designed to provide students with the skills and knowledge to influence and lead social impact in business and impact contexts.

The course will pivot around on a singular social issue through which to learn and test social impact frameworks and concepts. The issue of teens and young adults who are neither working nor in school provides a nice foil for our learning. Once students have gained a mastery of perspectives and methodologies necessary to consider and address a social issue from the ground up, they will next learn to identify and utilize effective measures of outputs and progress, and explore the core levers and potentials to change outcomes for people, communities and market systems. This class utilizes a digital, gamified exercise crafted specifically for this course.

As more corporations and investors look to deploy capital for investment in minority owned businesses, it will be critical for both the target companies and investment firms to have the strategic guidance and frameworks to increase their capacity to access and develop capital respectfully.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOver the course of this class, students, faculty, and client companies will focus in on the following central questions: (1) How can investors shift the ways in which they evaluate the opportunity and risk inherent to investment in underrepresented founders and their business in order to find and support opportunities that are currently being overlooked?; (2) How can underrepresented founders better understand how investment prospects are evaluated in order to present their strongest case to potential investors and access capital for growth and scale?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis class will provide students with an understanding of the heuristics - shortcuts - often relied on by investors as they seek to determine their interest in, and the value of ventures presented to them. Students will further learn frameworks and approaches that both investors and clients can use to identify and manage for these heuristics when they risk derailing an underrepresented founder\u0027s venture from measured consideration. Students will gain and master new approaches and perspectives on the inherent value and valuation of new and scaling businesses. Using a strengths-based framing and approach, students will learn techniques to value opportunities in investing in underrepresented founders, going beyond the heuristics we\u0027ve explored.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eCorequisite:\u003c/b\u003e FINC-430 or equivalent\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRecommended prerequisite courses:\u003c/b\u003e FINC-445 Entrepreneurial Finance and Venture Capital; MORS 952-5 Entrepreneurship: Building Innovation, Teams, and Cultures; ENTR-470 Launching and Leading Startups; ENTR 615 Growth Strategy Practicum;\u003c/p\u003e"""
Business Strategy,"""Strategy is the set of objectives, policies and resource commitments that collectively determine how a business positions itself to create wealth for its owners. This course introduces students to principles and conceptual frameworks for evaluating and formulating business strategy. Topics include the boundaries of the firm, the analysis of industry economics, strategic positioning and competitive advantage, and the role of resources and capabilities in shaping and sustaining competitive advantages."""
People Analytics and Strategy,"""Hiring, developing, and retaining the right employees is crucial for success in modern firms. Big data is transforming how companies manage talent. This course will teach you how to combine economic frameworks and data analytics to make better-informed decisions on personnel strategy. The course is organized around the \""life-cycle\"" of an employee at a company, starting from hiring, then training, compensation, promotions, benefits, diversity and discrimination, and retention. Each week, we will discuss one stage of this process, using a case discussion to highlight the tradeoffs that companies face, followed by a related data application in the next class. For example, we will use analytics in class to predict the potential of applicants to improve hiring decisions or we will use experimental designs to evaluate the effectiveness of training programs. This class is designed for MBA students who aspire to start, lead, and build businesses; this is not a course for those interested in careers as administrators of human resource management systems. The deliverables consist of in-class case discussions, as well as several individual and group homework assignments and a final take-home exam."""
Intellectual Capital Management,"""This course addresses the strategic question \""How do innovators own and leverage what they build?\"" The topic is important for professionals who seek to build a difference that makes a difference in the marketplace. The course follows a \""lifecycle\"" approach to the management of ideas and intellectual capital covering the creation and codification of the asset in the form of property (IP), valuation, and leveraging of same into markets for growth. Case studies examine health care, education, software/artificial intelligence, media, food/agriculture, entertainment, finance, consumer durables and other contexts.  The \""open innovation\"" option is considered in each context. Guest speakers and case studies include traditionally underrepresented minority founders/executive/inventors/innovators and why/how they practice inclusivity to grow their businesses. There is an individual take home case study (midterm) and group final project."""
Healthcare Strategy,"""\u003cp\u003eThis course delves into the strategic issues faced by healthcare firms. We will use concepts from the core strategy course (STRT-431) as an organizing framework, and discuss where and why the healthcare sector deviates from the norm. For example, what is the role of competitive positioning when quality is so difficult to measure?  How can you remain profitable if you compete against not-for-profits who don\u0027t face taxes?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBecause a great deal of healthcare strategy relies on understanding the nitty-gritty of particular industries, we will spend time learning about several of these, including health insurance, hospitals, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices.  Although our focus is on private firms in the U.S., we will (of necessity) be discussing the role of the government in regulating and providing healthcare, and (time permitting) discuss some international issues.

Topics range from succession and family dynamics to continuity planning and strategic performance. The course is also appropriate for those who have family foundations, family investment companies, or family offices. The class involves case discussions, guest speakers, field and research assignments, and presentations of new ideas in family enterprises."""
Strategy and Organization,"""This course focuses on the link between organizational structure and strategy, making use of the microeconomic tools taught in MECN-430. The core question is how firms should be organized to achieve their performance objectives. The first part of the course takes the firm\u0027s activities as given and studies the problem of organizational design; topics may include incentive pay, decentralization, transfer pricing, behavioral biases, and complementarities. The second part examines the determinants of a firm\u0027s boundaries and may cover such topics as outsourcing, horizontal mergers, and strategic commitment. Course deliverables include an-in person final exam."""
The Economics of Energy Markets and the Environment,"""TThis course is about the economics of energy markets. Energy industries are particularly strongly driven by fundamental economic forces, which means that strategy setting and decision making in energy (and energy-facing) industries relies on having a good understanding of how energy markets work. While the course will cover various energy industries, the main emphasis will be on microeconomic tools of analysis that are useful across multiple industries. Topics include the drivers of supply and demand in competitive energy markets, including the roles of storage and transportation; market power and antitrust concerns; and the rationale for economic and environmental regulations. Class time will be a mix of lecture and discussions. The lectures will present formal microeconomic models of energy markets and describe relevant energy market institutions. Class discussion will focus on using the economic models presented in class to understand current events in various energy industries. Students should expect daily reading assignments of 6-10 popular press articles that will form the basis of class discussion. The course deliverables include regular homework assignments and a final exam."""

It equips managers with a comprehensive framework to formulate strategies in the global marketplace. While accessible to students who have not yet taken Microeconomic Analysis, this course emphasizes economic analysis of the forces driving international business. The course covers competitive advantage, competitive strategies, alternative modes of market entry, including import and export through intermediaries, contracting with suppliers and distributors, and foreign direct investment (FDI). Case studies are used throughout to illustrate the basic principles of multinational business management and strategy."""
FinTech Strategy,"""Financial Technology (FinTech) firms are changing the type, frequency, and the way we use financial services. FinTech innovations have a great capacity to transform the financial system because many of these innovations are at a deeper level than traditional financial innovation. Blockchain, for example, can speed up clearing while keeping it secure, as opposed to an introduction of a new type of security which only changes small features of an existing product. FinTech companies attract a lot of VC money. Many of these initiatives, however, will likely turn out to be not sustainable. This course \u003cstrong\u003ebuilds upon your existing courses and frameworks\u003c/strong\u003e to provide the tools necessary for crafting successful strategies for fintechs to compete with traditional financial institutions (TFIs) as well as for TFIs to compete with fintechs.

Discussion questions, group project, and final exam."""
Technology and Innovation Strategy,"""This course develops approaches to analyzing strategies within technology markets. It teaches students how to analyze technology markets, where firm structure, product cycles and competitive environment change rapidly. The course offers tools to analyzing both entrepreneurial and corporate innovation strategy. These issues are illustrated through general readings and with cases from computing, electronics, online, communication, and transportation markets. The course strikes a balance between presenting a few general models of market behavior and presenting a few key episodes of market behavior. It is aimed at three types of students: those who anticipate taking management positions in technology-intensive firms where they must formulate strategy, those who anticipate investing in technology markets and must analyze firm strategy, and those who anticipate contracting with firms that do much of their business in these types of markets. Discussion questions, individual assignment, and final exam."""

Strategic Challenges in Emerging Markets,"""Globalization presents central opportunities and challenges for business growth. Whether a firm seeks new markets for its products, lower-cost production opportunities, or high-yield investment vehicles, many of the most attractive opportunities internationally lie in \""emerging markets\"" in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere. At the same time, these business environments present special risks and challenges.  Achieving competitive advantage in emerging markets depends on the firm\u0027s ability to manage the risks posed by weak legal systems, which limit the enforceability of contracts and property rights while amplifying the challenges of corruption, as well as managing through the macroeconomic, trade policy, and political regime shocks that regularly visit emerging market environments.  \r\n\r\nThis course provides toolkits and frameworks to successfully confront these challenges. The course will integrate numerous business examples with insights from the latest economics, business strategy, and political science research to provide the international business manager with a cutting-edge, integrated perspective on globalization and a set of strategic solutions to manage the most prevalent business risks in emerging markets."""
Analytics for Strategy,"""This course is an advanced analytics elective that uses data to inform strategic decisions. Should a fast food chain enter the highly profitable breakfast market segment? Not if the incumbents will respond by competing aggressively. Can a bank raise profits by attracting more customers through generous loan terms? Not if it inadvertently attracts risky customers. Data-driven analyses of such issues require going beyond statistically significant relationships (profitability in current market conditions, overall demand for generous loans) to assess underlying cause and effect. The course tackles a broad range of topics in competitive strategy, such as product portfolios (is it profitable to enter a rival\u0027s niche?), personnel (do workplace perks reduce absenteeism?), and cost reduction (is it profitable to adopt a new technology?). Students will learn through hands-on experience with performing advanced regression analyses and interpreting their results.\u003cB\u003eStudents who have not taken the pre-requisite, DECS 431 Business Analytics II, but have knowledge in regression and coding, can reach out to the instructor for a pre-requisite waiver \u003c/B\u003e"""

The Economics of Transportation Infrastructure and Markets,"""Transportation infrastructure, and the markets for transportation services it enables, form the bloodstream of an economy. They open up opportunities for mobilityâ€•the ability of people or goods to be moved from one location to another. Without this ability, economic activity would be severely restricted. Economic prosperity has historically depended on the mobility enabled by the development of transportation networks. As recent events in the wake of the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia illustrate, even in the richest economies around the world, economic well-being continues to depend on access to transportation. \r\n\r\nTransportation also has profound social consequences. The location of transportation infrastructure affects where people live and how they use land. Transportation infrastructure and transport services support global trade and migration, and they have relevance in geopolitical disputes. Transportation services are a significant source of pollution, and they raise important concerns about safety. Changes in how transportation services will be provided will be at the forefront of potential solutions to mitigate climate change, while at the same time transportation infrastructure will almost certainly have to be made more resilient in the face of climate change.\r\n\r\nThis course will provide students with an opportunity to undertake an in-depth study of transportation economics and the public policy and strategic issues that arise around transportation infrastructure and markets for transportation services. Transportation economics is a field within microeconomics that draws upon price theory, welfare economics, and econometrics to study specific contexts and complexities that arise in transportation infrastructure, the markets for transportation services, and public policy toward transportation. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this class is to illustrate how frameworks and tools from microeconomics can be adapted to the study of transportation and mobility. Students will learn how these frameworks and tools can be valuable in formulating good public policies governing transportation infrastructure and in developing effective business strategies for firms operating in transportation markets."""
